06/06/21 - 13/06/21: Various tutorials on creating 'first apps' / introduction to UI components 
15/06/21: UI Testing on Android using Espresso, Fragments 
16/06/21: ViewModel and Fragment videos, Android Architecture Components Beginner Video. 
Started trying to write unit tests for app but many issues: 
*Using Fragment > Activity to build UI as Fragment has shorter/easier to control life cycle + works with ViewModel, which we want to be 'UI Manager' in future
*But examples given by android doc for Activity class or if for Fragment, written in Kotlin. Can't work out why FragmentScenario class won't run...
*Written a not v good large instrumental test, but wanted to write small, precise unit test --TODO
20/06/21: Android is written in Java 8 - some backwards compatibility adjustments. Put @RequiresApi annotation in ViewModel first iteration.




Q&A

Q: What is the difference between FragmentManager and ViewModel?
A: FM is built-in to the Android Framework and doesn't need dev implementation. 
VM is a 'helper class' that looks after the <i>lifecycle</i> of UI components.
